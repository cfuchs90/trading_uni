The analysis relies on a large representative sample drawn from eight European Union countries. Preferences over time, risk and losses were elicited and jointly estimated from participant choices in incentivized, context-free multiple price list experiments. The findings from econometrically estimating EET adoption equations suggest that present-biased individuals are less likely to adopt EETs. They also provide (weak) evidence that individuals which are more risk-averse, or more loss-averse, or which exhibit a lower discount factor are less likely to adopt EETs. Finally, omitting one or several of the time and risk or loss-aversion parameters when estimating the EET adoption equations did not appear to cause omitted variable bias.},

However, we find that Chinese students are less consistent in matching their perceived tolerance levels with actual scores from a standard risk tolerance assessment. Further, we also examine mock portfolios created by the respondents and find no evidence that Chinese students create portfolios that are riskier than their American counterparts. Our findings suggest that differences in risk tolerance are at least partially a product of culture, but such differences may not always translate into actual investment decisions.},

	abstract = {Everyday life is full of self-control problems. The economist’s favorite explanation for self-control problems is present bias. This paper tests whether experimentally elicited present bias predicts self-control problems in everyday life. We measure present bias by using a standard incentivized delay discounting task and everyday self-control by using the day reconstruction method (DRM). Because this is the ﬁrst study to measure everyday self-control by using the DRM, we also validate the method by showing that its data replicate key results from the seminal Everyday Temptation Study. We ﬁnd that present bias does not predict everyday self-control. This points to a distinction between decreasing impatience (as measured in delay discounting tasks) and visceral inﬂuences (as occurring in everyday life) as determinants of self-control problems. We argue that decision making research can beneﬁt from the DRM as a cost-effective tool that complements lab and ﬁeld experiments to better understand economic preference measures and their correlates in everyday life decision making.

Comparing these ﬁndings to the predictions of a dynamic discrete choice model, we conclude that many gym members use bookings to commit themselves to future attendance.},

	abstract = {Empirically observed intertemporal choices about money have long been thought to exhibit present bias, i.e. higher short-term compared to long-term discount rates. Recently, this view has been called into question on both empirical and theoretical grounds, and a spate of recent findings suggest that present bias for money is minimal or non-existent when one allows for curvature in the utility function and transaction costs are tightly controlled. However, an alternative interpretation of many of these findings is that, in the interest of equalizing transaction costs across earlier and later payments, small delays were introduced between the time of the experiment and the soonest payment. We conduct a laboratory experiment in Kenya in which we elicit time and risk preference parameters from 494 participants, using convex time budgets and tightly controlling for transaction costs. We vary whether same-day payments are made immediately after the experimental session or at the close of the business day. Using the Kenyan mobile money system M-Pesa to make real-time transfers to subjects' phones allows us to make the soonest payments truly immediate. We find strong evidence of present bias, with estimates of the present bias parameter ranging from 0.902 to 0.924 — but only when same-day payments are made immediately after the experiment. This result suggests that present bias for money does in fact exist, but only for truly immediate payments.},

One way to deal with one’s present-bias problem is to impose limits on future spending by holding wealth in non-liquid assets. We therefore predict that agents with more severe presentbias problems hold a lower share of their wealth as money. Our data provide statistically signiﬁcant evidence in support of this prediction.},

We define a procrastinator as an individual who waits until the last day of their health care open enrollment period to make their plan election. We show that procrastinators are: (i) less likely to participate in a supplemental savings plan, (ii) take longer to sign up for 401(k) plans, (iii) contribute less, (iv) are more likely to stick with default portfolio allocations, and (v) are more likely to choose a lump sum (over an annuity) as payout option from their DB plan, especially when the lump sum is more salient. Further evidence shows that these findings are best explained by procrastination being the outcome of present-biased preferences, consistent with the leading economic models of procrastination.},
